 <p>	James wakes up in a dark room, barely able to see anything.  He is unsure as to why he's there and no background is given pertaining to who he is.  Disoriented, he rises from the bed is lying on and proceeds to search the room for some source of light.  He opens the armoire doors and finds a lantern with very little fuel remaining.  Turning on the lantern, he holds it high and surveys the room.  It is simply furnished with a wooden desk, a small bed, and the armoire, with no windows offering answers to where he might be.  Suddenly, he hears a scratching at the door.  Frightened he extinguishes the lantern's flame and heads towards the armoire.  Fumbling, he climbs inside and closes the doors best he can.  Doing his best to keep his breathing light, for a moment the deafening silence is only disturbed by James’s pounding heart.  Then, a slow creak is heard as the door in the room is pushed open.  James ceases breathing altogether, and closes his eyes to the darkness.  Something lurks outside of the armoire doors and James can hear the creature shuffling about the room.  Nails hit the wood of the armoire and rake across the surface lightly, filling James with fear.  He quells the cry that waits to sound in his throat and clutches the lantern, ready to strike whatever may open the doors.  Then the scratching halts and low sound echoes in the room, a sort of gurgling.  The creature shuffles about for another minute before its steps fade as it exits towards the unknown.  After what feels like an hour, James tentatively opens the armoire doors and tries to discern any movement in the room.  Satisfied with the black stillness, he reignites the lantern and unfolds from his cramped position.  He looks around in the illuminated space and heads towards the now-open door.  Poking his head into the hallway, he starts to leave the room behind.  Just as he steps across the threshold, he is hit by a massive weight that drags him down.  Teeth tear into the flesh of James’s shoulder and he cries out in pain.
HE DIES.

<p>Before programming using Python, my partner Thea and I first developed a storyline to our short but interactive story, In which a guy named James wakes up in a very dark room not able to reminisce as to why he woke up there confused and scared. It’s up to the player of the game to decide the fate of James as he navigates his way along the enigmatic house to seek for an explanation. During the coding procedure my partner Thea had a lot of trouble trying to decipher the timing procedure on python because without it, the texts wouldn’t be realistic as opposed to having it. We also had a little trouble on coding the “yes” and “no” to the game but we got it all figured out. During times of complex coding Jose would test the game for errors, such as grammar issues, timing, and he would offer Thea his moral support. Overall the game is rated at 10 out of 10 being that it plays with the player's mind and the story is excellent.</p>
